Coding Standards
================

* Do not write functions, use methods in classes only
* Each method should have one purpose only, abstraction is the key to a KISS framework
* Comment on code, but don't document it, you should document your code externally
* Use mutators and accessors as opposed to public properties
* If you can set something, for security you should also be able to get it too
* Avoid abbreviations, use full words instead
* Properties should be named using camel-cased named
* Classes should use underscores to separate words
* CSS classes should use underscores opposed to dashes or camel-cased naming
* URL's should use dashes opposed to underscores or camel-cased naming, all words should be lowercase
